LuaJIT decompiler (or more of a bytecode re-assembler)
======================================================

Here's a thing I done made that re-assembles LuaJIT from it's assembly-bytecode (or when used with LuaJIT itself can decompile LuaJIT files)


## If you have any questions on how to use it then read the wiki ##

## This version is good enough for me (at the moment) so I don't think I will be updating it any time soon ##
Things that still need to be added:
* table lookups
* uget lookups (if thats possible?)

By using this you agree that you will not modify anything for malicious purposes, or redistribute source code (decompiled or not) of anything using LuaJIT
